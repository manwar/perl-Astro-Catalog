v4.24

  + recommend that Astro::FITS::CFITSIO is installed rather than
    requiring it. We can't guarantee that people have the CFITSIO
    library installed.

v4.23

  + Tk::AstroCatalog now calls the onDestroy method correctly
    when the widget is closed from the window manager (Graham Bell)

v4.22

  + Use File::Temp for temporary files in tests.
  + Can now take IO::Handle objects for read_catalog and
    write_catalog.

v4.21

  + Remove code that relies on CVS $Revision$ tags. Those
    modules have now been updated to v2.00 to ensure that they
    are seen as new.

v4.2

  + The MPC web service seems to have changed so MPC is not functioning
    in this release.

    and LCOGFITSTable formats.
  - Now uses Module::Build
  - SuperCOSMOS and SIMBAD query classes have been removed since the
    remote format has changed.
